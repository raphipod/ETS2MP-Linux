# TruckersMP-Linux

Two automation shell scripts that work with truckersmp-cli

## How to use?

1. Download ETS2/ATS in Linux native Steam client with Proton (not the native Linux version!!)
2. Run the game once to create necessary files for the next steps.
3. Download [truckersmp-cli](https://github.com/lhark/truckersmp-cli).
4. Open the game directory of ETS2/ATS, and create a new folder called "mp"
5. Unpack truckersmp-cli, and put the contained files into the newly created "mp"-folder (-> */Euro Truck Simulator 2/mp/files*, not /Euro Truck Simulator 2/mp/truckersmp-cli/files)
6. Edit ETS2MP or ATSMP accordingly to your file location, and don't forget to change your steam username. Make it executable.
7. Then, place this file into the "mp" folder.
8. Start the script, and enjoy your game!

Only use "install-proton" if you have the native Steam client installed!
